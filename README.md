# LINFO2252-SOFT-PROJECT
Project for the course of software maintenance and evolution

To launch the project, it is just necessary to launch the .jar we provided.

We have populated the database with fake users to show notifications and to view the mandatory features
that we already have implemented. I.e. chat, notifications, contacts...

Here is the list of user 

kim 123
fra 456
alex 789
sox sox

You can login with kim and fra to show new messages and to view the chat

After logging in, you will be able to:
View all chats
View the notifications
Activate a feature
Deactivate a feature

Activating a feature will display additional infos in the screen.
We have implemented two optional features (beware, the sdk might be bugged and show the features inversed, 
to select the "STATUS" feature, press 1, to select the "RESEARCH" feature, press 2), research and status.
With status, you can see the status of your contacts when you view your chats.
With research, you'll be able to search for a substring in all the messages of a chat with a user.
